define what a tree is

what is a tree?
    a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/ child relationship
    every node is moving away from the root node
    root- top node in a tree
    child- a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
    parent- the converse notion of a child
    siblings- a group of nodes with the same parent
    leaf- a node with no children

tree vs binary tree
    tree - can have any number of children
    binary - can have at most 2 children (cannot have 3 or more children from any parents)
    binary search tree - at most 2 children, kept in certain order, used to store data that can be compared and sorted, every node to left is less than parent
